# video_summarizer
This repo will contain the code to build and deploy a video summarizer from scratch.

This repo is inspired to build and E2E solution which will take a video as an input and will generate a summarized video as an output. Though there are multiple solutions which generates transcripts out of a video but I didn't find any staisfactory solution for video summaries. This project tries to bridge this gap.
